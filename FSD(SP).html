        <h1>RUGBY</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="left">
        Rugby is a dynamic and physically demanding team sport that emphasizes strength, strategy, and endurance. Originating in England during the early 19th century, it has evolved into a globally celebrated game with two primary formats: Rugby Union and Rugby Sevens. The main objective in rugby is to accumulate more points than the opposing team by advancing the ball into their in-goal area and grounding it to score a try. After scoring a try, the team has an opportunity to add two additional points through a conversion kick, while penalty kicks and drop goals can score three points each.The game involves passing and kicking the ball while tackling opponents to gain possession, with set pieces like scrums and lineouts restarting play after certain stoppages.Rugby Union, the most popular format, features 15 players per team and two halves of 40 minutes each. In Rugby Union, players are divided into forwards and backs, each with specific roles. Forwards, such as props, hookers, locks, flankers, and number eights, focus on scrums and physical play, while backs, including scrum-halves, fly-halves, centers, wingers, and full-backs, are responsible for quick passes, strategic kicks, and scoring tries.â€‹</p>
